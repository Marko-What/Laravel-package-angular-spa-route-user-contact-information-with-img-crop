app needs to exist inside a laravel public folder so that files could be reference by laravel  view index page. Single route.
By my examination laravel function asset 

	declearing a reference to a folder outside a public folder.

	Could be done just by using linux commands to link, associate files/folder by either cause of easier to implement ... 
	to paste a folder inside a public laravel folder
